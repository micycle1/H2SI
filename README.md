# H2SI
Implementation of the H2SI (Hilbert square, super-importance) colour space, a perceptual colour space designed to match human color perception.

This implementation is based on the paper "H2SI – A New Perceptual Colour Space" by Michael Nölle, Martin Suda, and Winfried Boxleitner. The colour space provides a metric that closely aligns with human color perception while maintaining mathematical properties suitable for algorithmic image processing.
